# 	( code for MSP430 microcontroller used on the combined subsystem in charge of Etch-a-Sketch, 
# 	Rubik's cube, and the lift motor control )
# 	
# 	Files included: 
# 	-> one Main.c type file with all functions declared within 
# 	-> one IAR Embedded Workbench project file 
# 
# 	Things Needed to Use: 
# 	-> *** this code written in IAR Embedded Workbench ***
# 		--> some libraries used are linked by default in the compiler that IDE uses, so the 
# 		code will likely only compile using that program (unless maybe you have all necessary 
# 		libraries linked manually in some other compiler of your choice)
